## About this event

The second Project Teams Gathering of 2023 will be held virtually October 23-27.

The Project Teams Gathering (PTG) is an event organized by the OpenInfra Foundation. It provides meeting facilities allowing the various technical community groups working with OpenInfra (user workgroups, development teams, operators, SIGs) to meet in-person, exchange and get work done in a productive setting. It lets those various groups discuss their priorities for the upcoming cycle, assign work items, iterate quickly on solutions for complex problems, and make fast progress on critical issues. The co-location of those various meetings, combined with the dynamic scheduling of the event, make it easy to get specific people in the same room to discuss a specific topic, or participate in multiple team meetings. Evenings allow for relationship building and problem sharing.

### SCHEDULE

The schedule is not set yet, but when it becomes available, you will be able to see it via the PTGBot[1].

### IRC

The main form of synchronous communication between attendees during the PTG is on IRC. If you are not on IRC, learn how to get started here[2]. The main PTG IRC channel is #openinfra-events on the OFTC network. It's also used to interact with the PTGbot, and where Foundation staff will be present to help answer questions.

### PTGBOT

The PTGbot[1] is an open source tool that PTG track moderators use to surface what's currently happening at the event.

Track moderators will send messages to the bot via the #openinfra-events channel on IRC, and from that information, the bot publishes a webpage with several sections of information:

- The discussion topics currently discussed in the room ("now")

- An indicative set of discussion topics coming up next ("next")

- The schedule for the day with available extra slots for your team to book, should you need additional meeting time.

Learn more about the PTGbot via the documentation here[3].
